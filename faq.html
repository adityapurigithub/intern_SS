                This year sessions are grouped into four channels based on
                interest/job function: Developer, Enterprise, Univers(ity) and
                Play.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developer: geared towards open source contributors and
                maintainers running projects of all sizes, as well as developers
                looking to understand the latest software tools, techniques, and
                best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enterprise: tailored for senior leaders and decision-makers from
                global companies interested in transformation, security,
                scalability, and productivity. Univers(ity): designed
                specifically for college students seeking the tools, techniques,
                and connections that will help expand their resumes and prepare
                them for their future. Play: take a break, get inspired, or
                discover something new with entertaining performances,
                tutorials, and unexpected stories, all driven by code. And is
                flexible - you can focus on one channel, or decide to
                pick-and-choose sessions that are most interesting and relevant
                to you across the program. All talks will require basic software
                understanding, there will not be entry-level sessions.

                Startup Story B2B Connect Discussions is a product feature we
                rolled out at Startup Story B2B Connect Satellite. It’s a tool
                developers are encouraged to use to improve their workflows—and
                we will be using it for community conversations throughout the
                event.
              </p>
              <p>
                Discussions live in your project repository, so they’re
                accessible where your community is already working together.
                Their threaded format makes it easy to start, respond to, and
                organize unstructured conversations. Questions can be marked as
                answered, so over time a community’s knowledge base grows
                naturally. And because discussions aren’t closed the way issues
                are, they can easily serve as a place for maintaining FAQs and
                other collaborative documentation. We recognize that community
                discussion is as much a part of development as coding, so
                discussion contributions appear in users’ contribution graphs.
